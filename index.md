# Hello World!

My name is Thomas Cross and this is my attempt at a portfolio.  

I am currently living in Omaha Nebraska working as a Software Engineer.  I have over ten years of experience in the field of Information Technology.  I started by learning about Linux system administration and eventually found out about port forwarding and DNS and quickly had a “website in my basement” before I graduated high school.  After that Linux, internet, HTTP, and programming quickly became my obsessions.

I graduated from the University of Nebraska at Omaha Peter Kiewit Institute with a Bachelors in Computer Science with an emphasis on Internet Systems and Parallel Computation.  In my spare time I mastered HTTP standards and exposing them as web services.  I worked for the university in student enrollment services as a web developer migrating all our sites from a windows stack to a LAMP stack with our custom MVC environment.  My senior year I participated in an independent study about Combinatorial Algorithms on GPUs.

I am a polyglot and consider myself well rounded with experience in embedded, machine learning, data ETL, SQL, docker, kubernetes, infrastructure as a service, cloud solutions, web services/back end development, and more.  My front end skills have been neglected so lately I have been improving my front end experience by learning the latest tools and techniques to make me more effective as a "full stack" engineer.

I love meeting new people and hearing their stories so feel free to contact me on linked in.

Thanks for reading!
